<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>Whatever may be the status of the project system
of teaching other subjects, it is coming to be quite
generally agreed that the home project offers one of
the best methods for teaching elementary agriculture.
The essentials of the home project plan are as follows:
(1) A definite, detailed plan for work at home covering
a season or more or less extended period of time;
(2) it must be a part of the instruction of the school in
agriculture; (3) the parents and pupils should agree
with the teacher upon the plan; (4) the home work
must have competent supervision; (5) records and reports
of time, method, cost and income must be honestly
kept and submitted to the teacher.</p>

<p>In the study and practice of a vocational subject
such as agriculture, we may distinguish three aspects,
each involving distinct pedagogical characteristics and
special problems of administration. The first includes
the concrete, specific, or practical work, such as the
actual making of a garden, the raising of poultry, or
the growing of corn; the second involves a study of
such technical sciences as botany, physics, chemistry,
and the principles of the agricultural science relating
directly to the subject of agriculture under consideration;
the third aspect includes such general information
as the history, economic values, and other interesting
facts of that particular phase of agriculture
being studied. Doctor Snedden states in his “Problems
of Secondary Education,” that the keynote of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
newer education in these fields is to be found in the
development of facilities for obtaining practical experience,
under conditions as nearly approximating
those of the actual vocation as can be obtained.</p>

<p>It is for the purpose of making as practical as possible
some of the principles of scientific agriculture for
the boys and girls of the public schools, and of giving
direct vocational value to such work that this little
book, the third of a series, is submitted. The plan
outlines one project in each booklet, supplying the project
directions, practical exercises for laboratory work,
subject-matter for study and recitation, and notebook
forms for accounts and records. The school work in
elementary agriculture for one year may be based upon
one or two projects, giving opportunity to supply new
subject-matter by rotation each year; or the project
method may be used to supplement the text-book method
as used either in the elementary or high-school grades.
In either case, the boys and girls doing the project
work should be organized into a club and affiliated with
the State Boys and Girls Club movement through the
state leader, usually located at the State College of
Agriculture.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">To the Teacher</span></h2>

<p>Teachers of agriculture are beginning to realize that
the swine industry may be utilized to advantage in the
training of young farmers. Pig raising makes a good
home project. Most boys in the country, and some
girls, will find a way to keep one or more pigs if their
interest is aroused. The class work may be centered
around the project, or the project may supplement and
furnish the practical work in connection with a text-book
study of general agriculture. With one or two
class-room recitations a week based upon reports of
the progress and problems of the project, upon the
practical exercises herein given, and upon the subject-matter
and project outline study presented in <a href="#PART_IV">Part IV</a>;
including also some Friday afternoon club programs as
suggested, and with the actual work being done at
home, a course in agriculture of real, practical worth
may be given in any school. Pig raising enables a boy
to enter in a small way into the live-stock business.
Comparatively little capital is required and quick returns
are secured. With good management a small
beginning will soon result in a herd of good size. The
teacher should make use of the studies connected with
the pig raising project to bring out the essentials of
general animal production. Much that is learned regarding
the feeding and breeding of swine may be
applied to raising other animals.</p>

<p>It is not necessary that the teacher be an expert in
swine husbandry to make this project a success. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
teacher may help greatly by being an interested co-worker,
encouraging the boys and girls, learning with
them, leading them to sources of information, and being
a sympathetic friend in their work and life on the farm.</p>

<p>If possible, each member of the class should be induced
to begin the pig raising project with a pure-bred
gilt. If this is not possible, any pig may be selected,
fed, and cared for according to the project directions.
The home project may be carried on as an independent
class activity, or it may be correlated with the work
of the pig club organization. It will be an easy matter
and a most desirable thing to do to organize the
class into a pig club, affiliate with the state club movement,
and all work together in the big business of food
production.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">September</span></h3>

<p>1. <b>Organization of the club.</b> See plans for club
organization in the appendix. The class in elementary
agriculture undertaking to base its work largely upon
the home project should organize as directed by the
club plan. Each member of the class should become
a member of the club and plan to do all the work outlined
for the project. The plan should meet with the
approval of the board of education, of the parents of
the boys and girls undertaking the project, and should
have the hearty support of the county superintendent
of schools, of the teacher and of the pupils themselves
who are to do the work. The state club leader at the
State College of Agriculture should be notified of the
organization of the club so that he may send enrollment
blanks and all such literature and publications
as will be helpful in the progress of the work.</p>

<p>2. <b>Getting started.</b> For the pig raising project
members of the class or club may start with one or
several pigs, or with a sow pig (or gilt) bred to farrow
early in October, since this is to be a project for the
entire year. A pig belonging to one of the breeds most
prevalent in the community should be selected, provided,
of course, that it is a breed which is adapted to local
conditions and meets market requirements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>In making the selection of the gilt, consider the pedigree
and the individuality of the animal. Unless you
know the pedigree it is best to leave that to the reliable
breeder with whom you are dealing. Every member of
the class joining the pig club should learn how to pick
out a good pig. In the beginning, however, it would
be well to depend upon the judgment of an experienced
man in the selection of the gilt for the year’s project.</p>

<p>3. <b>Beginning the record.</b> On the blank pages provided
in <a href="#PART_IV">Part IV</a> of this book write a brief history
and description of the breed of hog you select. Each
pupil should keep a neat and accurate record of all
operations, accounts, results, etc., on the pages provided
for the pig raising project.</p>

<p>4. <b>Registering the pigs.</b> If a pure-bred gilt is the
starting point of the project, the club member should
get the experience of following the rules of registration
for the breed. Send to the secretary of the breed
association for full information and blank forms, free
of charge. When an animal is sold, a certificate of
registration will be appreciated by the purchaser. Fill
out the registration record in the form given in <a href="#PART_IV">Part
IV</a> of this book.</p>

<p>5. <b>A place for the pig.</b> The first problem after
securing a good pig is that of proper care and management.
Pigs need clean food, clean water, exercise
and a clean bed, if they are to thrive and be profitable.
See to it that your pigs have a dry, warm, clean, and
well-ventilated house. Sunshine is a good warmer and
disinfectant of the hog house. For the beginner the
individual house of the A type or square type is recommended.
A good pasture will provide cheap, clean
food, exercise and a clean bed during the summer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">October</span></h3>

<p>1. <b>Feeding the young sow.</b> Not more than two-thirds
of the grain ration of the young brood sow should
be corn. Good feeders prefer to use ground oats and
middlings with milk or tankage<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> in connection with
corn. The young sow should be kept in good, strong
condition but not overloaded with fat. The following
ration is one good one recommended:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(a) A pasture should furnish the bulky part of the ration.</p>

<p>(b) A meal ration consisting of equal parts corn, ground
oats and middlings. If the pasture is a good one the sow will
need little other feed for several weeks. The meal ration
should be begun several weeks before farrowing.</p>

<p>(c) Roots may be fed whole or pulped and mixed with meal.</p>

<p>(d) Alfalfa or clover hay is good in the ration.</p>

<p>(e) Skim-milk is excellent for sows.</p>

<p>(f) For minerals keep a mixture of slack coal, two parts
by weight, air-slacked lime, one part, and salt, one part, before
the hogs all the time.</p>

</div>

<p>2. <b>Farrowing time.</b> At farrowing time place the
sow in a sheltered building, dry, free from draughts
and well-ventilated. To prevent the sow from lying
against the wall of the pen and thus injuring any little
pigs which may be lying there, it is a good plan to provide
a guard rail made of two by eight-inch planks
fastened with their edges against the sides of the pen
a little above the bed. The young sow should have a
liberal amount of bedding of cut straw. She should
have an individual pen or house, receive kind treatment
and have quiet quarters. If the sow remains quiet for
twelve hours or more after farrowing, so much the
better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>3. <b>Feeding and care of the nursing sow.</b> The feed
after farrowing should be about the same as before.
At first she should have little more than a drink. A
thin slop of middlings and water will serve. The sow
should not be overfed and should be given a week or
ten days to come to a full ration. The following is one
good ration recommended:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(a) Equal parts of ground oat and wheat middlings, allowed
to soak between feeds.</p>

<p>(b) Sweet skim-milk added to the above ration makes it
almost ideal.</p>

<p>(c) Corn may be used as recommended for sows before
farrowing.</p>

<p>(d) A certain amount of bulky, succulent feed such as hay
and roots helps to keep the sow healthy.</p>

<p>(e) When the pigs are weaned, the feed of the sow should
be cut down to check the flow of the milk. Dry oats are
recommended for this purpose.</p>

</div>

<p>4. <b>Record work.</b> Be sure to keep all records called
for on the record pages, including date of farrowing,
number of pigs, method of housing, feeding rations,
successes, failures, etc. Provision for weighing the pigs
from time to time should be provided.</p>

<p>5. <b>Reading and study.</b> In connection with the
practical work of raising your pigs, read at this time
what your text and reference books have to say about
care and management of the brood sow.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">November and December</span></h3>

<p>1. <b>Feeding the pigs.</b> About the first thought in
connection with raising pigs is that they eat. It is important
that every pig in the litter get its stomach full
of the first milk of the sow. The young pigs will learn
to eat when about three weeks of age. If the pigs can
be fed separately from the sow, better results will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
obtained. In one corner of the pen place a small
trough for the pigs and fence it off from the sow. At
least twice a day give the pigs as much sweet skim-milk
as they will clean up. Do not leave any milk to sour in
the trough. Then a few days after they begin to nibble
grass and drink milk, a gruel of oats and wheat middlings
may be made with the milk. Later a small
amount of corn soaked for twenty-four hours may be
placed in the trough. Do not feed more than they will
clean up. Young pigs may be weaned at from eight
to ten weeks.</p>

<p>2. <b>Some standard rations for growing pigs.</b></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(a) Fresh skim-milk as the base for a slop of oat middlings
and wheat middlings, to which add a small amount of corn.
(Feed three times daily.) As the pigs grow older the corn
and middlings may be increased, but the corn should not be
fed alone.</p>

<p>(b) With corn and skim-milk or buttermilk, one part by
weight of corn to three parts of milk is satisfactory after
weaning. Gradually increase the amount of corn so that the
175-pound pigs get about one part of corn to two parts of
skim-milk or buttermilk.</p>

<p>(c) With corn and tankage the following proportions are
advised:</p>

<table summary="Feed mix for pigs according to their weight">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">8 to 1</td>
    <td>by weight for pigs weighing between 40 and 90 pounds</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">10 to 1</td>
    <td>for weights between 90 and 125 pounds</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">12 to 1</td>
    <td>for weights between 125 and 175 pounds</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">14 to 1</td>
    <td>for weights between 175 and 225 pounds</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">16 to 1</td>
    <td>for market hogs above 225 pounds</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>(d) Garbage from the kitchen is usually valuable for hogs.
The value depends largely upon the amount and kind of solid
material which it contains. Where it is thin enough to pour
readily from the bucket, but not watery, it may be fed in
about the same proportion with corn as was recommended for
milk.</p>

<p>(e) To furnish minerals as recommended for the sow, keep
the following before the pigs at all times:</p>

<table summary="Mineral mix for pigs">
  <tr>
    <td>Slack coal or coal screenings</td>
    <td>2 parts</td>
    <td>by weight</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Air-slacked lime</td>
    <td>1 part</td>
    <td>by weight</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Salt</td>
    <td>1 part</td>
    <td>by weight</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>(f) A good pasture is always an excellent supplement to
any ration and lessens the amount of other feeds required.
Pasture-fed pigs are thriftier and make cheaper gains than
those fed in dry lots. In general feed from 3 to 5 pounds of
concentrates,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> such as corn, other grains, meals, tankage, etc.,
per 100 pounds live weight, according to age. For pigs in a
dry lot at weaning time (weighing about 40 pounds) feed 5
pounds concentrates per 100 pounds live weight, or 4 pounds
concentrates per day per 100 pounds live weight in access
to forage or pasture. No two herds of hogs feed just alike;
therefore it is the problem of the feeder to study the needs of
his hogs and try to supply them. Regularity in time of feeding,
dry, comfortable quarters, and sanitary conditions in pen
and lot are necessary to secure satisfactory gains.</p>

</div>

<p>3. <b>Housing the pigs.</b> Perhaps the main reason for
housing the pigs is to furnish a dry bed, and since hogs
do not shed their hair for warmer coats or thicken it up
as horses do, provision should be made to shelter the
hogs from the cold of winter as well as from the extreme
heat of summer. Reference has already been made to
the house for the sow and her litter of pigs. It is not
necessary to have expensive buildings, especially in the
beginning. Even a pen covered with boards and fresh
straw may meet all the requirements.</p>

<p>For the pig club boys and girls starting in to raise
two litters in a year, a good, cheap and easily constructed
pen is described as follows in Lippincott’s
“Productive Swine Husbandry”;</p>

<p>“The pen is sixteen feet long and eight feet wide.
It is seven feet high in front and three and one-half
feet high at the rear. It is boarded with cheap lumber,
but all cracks are securely battened. It should be practically
wind and rain proof. The opening should be a
small door in the southeast corner, as the house faces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the south. Plenty of bedding should be supplied, and
the pen should be banked up outside with fresh horse
manure to a depth of about two feet in order to prevent
drafts about the floor.”</p>

<p>4. <b>Records.</b> During the winter months do not fail
to make all records and keep all accounts of operations,
work, expenses, results, etc., that are called for on the
record pages of this book.</p>

<p>5. <b>Reference reading and study.</b> Read your texts,
the farm papers, and any reference books available on
the problems of feeding, housing, care and management
of growing pigs. Consult experienced swine
breeders and feeders and learn all you can from them
that will help you to succeed with your pigs.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">January and February</span></h3>

<p>1. <b>Breeding the sow for the second litter.</b> If an
April litter of pigs is desired, the sow should be bred
during the month of December or early January.
Breed to a pure-bred boar if possible. Keep record of
dates.</p>

<p>2. <b>Feeding continued.</b> Just as we use lumber,
brick, cement, shingles, nails, etc. in the proper form
and proportion in building a house, so must we use
milk, corn, oats, grass or other feeds in the building
of the body of the hog or any other animal. Each
feed is made up of different food nutrients, and each
food nutrient serves a definite purpose in the body.
Some of the food nutrients are used in the animal body
to make bone, others for fat, and still others for the
manufacture of active muscular tissue. Development
will be incomplete if any class of food material is
neglected; hence the necessity of a balanced ration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Follow carefully the feeding standards and rations
suggested for November and December.</p>

<p>3. <b>Keeping the pigs healthy.</b> It is much easier to
keep pigs healthy than it is to cure sick ones. Clean,
dry quarters, proper feed, plenty of sunlight and ventilation,
and disinfection of houses will help to keep pigs
healthy.</p>

<p>Go over your pig pen this month, and as often
thereafter as is necessary, and clean out all filth from
cracks and corners, floors and feeding troughs. Apply
the following disinfectant:</p>

<table summary="Mix for disinfectant">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">5</td>
    <td>parts crude carbolic acid in</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">100</td>
    <td>parts water</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Once a year the pig house should be whitewashed.
(<a href="#PART_III">See discussion in Part III.</a>) If possible, supply “hog
wallows and dips” for your pigs. (<a href="#PART_III">See Part III.</a>)</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">March and April</span></h3>

<p>1. <b>Starting the pig project at this time.</b> If it is
desired to start the pig project at this time instead of
in September, the club may be organized, a pure-bred
gilt to farrow in April purchased by each member of
the club, and the work started as suggested for September
and October.</p>

<p>2. <b>See the September and October calendar.</b> In all
essential points the members of the class beginning the
pig project at this time should follow every detail outlined
for September and October.</p>

<p>3. <b>The October pigs.</b> Continue the feeding rations
of the October pigs as suggested for other months,
according to weights and gains, and make larger use
of the pasture as a supplement as the spring advances.</p>

<p>Alfalfa pasture has proven by many tests to be one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
of the best for growing pigs. After the first season
for alfalfa, an acre should pasture two sows and their
litters throughout the season. The corn rations may be
cut one-half with alfalfa as a pasture. “Pigs in clover”
are contented and happy. An acre of good clover
should pasture one sow and her litter. A Missouri bulletin
recommends feeding shoats about a pound of corn
per head per day when on good clover pasture.</p>

<p>4. <b>The second litter.</b> If the second litter of pigs
for the sow for the year is farrowed in April, as was
recommended at the beginning of this project, quarters
separate from the October pigs should be provided for
them for at least eight weeks, or until the second litter is
weaned. See directions for the care and management
of the sow and pigs as given for September and
October.</p>

<p>5. <b>Records and study.</b> Continue to make all records
called for in the project. Read and study texts
and reference books relating to the work you are doing
each month.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">May and June</span></h3>

<p>1. <b>Summer feeding and pasture.</b> An acre of cow
peas or soy beans sown in May will furnish excellent
pasture for the spring pigs, especially when the pods
are formed about September. Rape is a good pasture
crop for hogs. It may be sown from April to
June and will be ready for pasture in about six weeks.
Six to eight pounds of seed will suffice for an acre when
sown broadcast. An acre of rape should pasture a sow
and her October and spring litters. Corn and shorts
may be used to supplement rape pasture. Continue the
feeding rations according to age and weight recommended
for former months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>2. <b>Breeding for October pigs.</b> During the third or
fourth week of June breed the sow for the October
litter of pigs. Breed to a pure-bred sire if possible.
Keep record of all dates.</p>

<p>3. <b>Shelter for the pigs.</b> During the summer it may
be necessary to provide a shelter from the direct rays
of the sun. A frame of poles covered with straw or
corn-stalks will serve this purpose.</p>

<p>4. <b>Hog wallows.</b> Since pigs do not perspire they
often suffer during the extreme heat of the summer.
They naturally seek the coolest wallow even though it
be a filthy mud hole. It would be humane as well as
good business to provide a concrete wallow and keep it
filled with eight or ten inches of water. Coal-tar or
crude oil added to the water will help to rid the pigs
of lice.</p>

<p>5. <b>Sanitary conditions.</b> During the summer
months continue to care for the cleanliness of all the
pens and house as suggested for the winter season. Seek
the advice of successful hog raisers and veterinarians
upon the slightest evidence of unhealthy pigs. See
discussion on worms and cholera in <a href="#PART_III">Part III</a>.</p>

<p>6. <b>Ringing the pigs.</b> One ring should not be placed
in the center of the pig’s nose, but if ringed at all, use
two rings, one on either side of the center of the nose,
close to the tendons running down to the pig’s snout.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">July and August</span></h3>

<p>1. <b>Getting ready for an exhibit.</b> If there is to be
a local, county, or state fair, club members will arrange
through their leader to have an exhibit of their pigs at
the fair. Follow carefully and honestly all directions
and rules laid down by your state club leader in entering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the contest and exhibiting your pigs. If there is
no fair or exhibit for you to attend, make one at your
local school. Your state club leader will send full directions
for all contests and exhibits.</p>

<p>2. <b>Preparing the pig for exhibition.</b><a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The first
thing to do toward getting the pig ready for a show is
to wash his body thoroughly with warm rain water,
and a good lathery soap. Use a stiff brush so that dirt
and dust will be removed. A little disinfectant in the
wash water would be a good thing. Thoroughly rinse
the soap out of the hair after washing and allow the
pig to dry in a clean, dry stall.</p>

<p><b>His coat.</b> When all the moisture has disappeared
from the hair and skin, a light application of sweet oil
may well be made, taking particular care to rub the oil
well into the skin. The oil will keep the hair and hide
soft and will give the pig a shiny coat, thereby improving
his appearance. The use of too much oil is objectionable,
both because it is apt to become “gummed” in
the hair and make the animal “sticky”, and because
it will soil the fingers of the people who will probably
stroke and pet the pig when he is taken to the show.
If sweet oil is not available, raw linseed oil may be
used instead, but a somewhat lighter application of
linseed oil should be made. Oil is seldom used on white
pigs.</p>

<p><b>The feet.</b> Frequently the pig’s feet will require
some attention. If the toes are too long or are broken
off so that they are rough, they should be trimmed
with a good sharp jackknife. This can be done best
when the animal is lying down. If the boy has taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
care of his animal properly, the pig will submit to such
handling without any objection. In fact he will like
to be played with and will enjoy having his master
work with him.</p>

<p>After the pig has been properly groomed he should
be kept in a dry stall that is bedded deep with clean
straw. If he shows an inclination to root down into
the dirt and soil himself by digging beneath his bedding,
rings should be placed in his nose. If not absolutely
necessary, however, it is better not to ring hogs
intended for show.</p>

<p><b>Make your pig gentle.</b> An hour a day should be
spent teaching the pig to stand still while being examined.
While it is not customary at big shows to hold
pigs while they are being judged, yet at a contest of
this kind the best trained pig will be looked upon with
special favor, since such a pig will signify to the judges
that his master has done everything possible “to bring
him out.”</p>

<p>3. <b>Marketing the pigs.</b> The October pigs will be
ready for the market this summer, probably as early
as July. Study carefully the market classes and grades
described in <a href="#PART_III">Part III</a>. Determine to which classes and
grades your pigs should belong. Watch carefully the
daily market reports in the papers. Seek the best
advice you can get on the important business of marketing
your pigs.</p>

<p>4. <b>Concluding work.</b> Finish all records called for
in <a href="#PART_IV">Part IV</a>. Achievement, as one boy puts it, is “getting
into the game, sticking to it, and finishing the job.”
Here is your chance to achieve not only a successful
and profitable piece of work for yourself, but a man’s
service in adding to the food supply of your country.</p>

<span class="smaller">PRACTICAL EXERCISES</span></h2>

<p>1. <b>Wild relatives of swine.</b> Pupils should prepare
written reports upon the following wild relatives of the
hog: peccary, wart hog, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, wild
boar. Consult geographies, natural histories and encyclopedias
for such information.</p>

<p>2. <b>Swine on the home farm.</b> Let each pupil report
on the swine on the home farm by filling out the following
table:</p>

<table summary="A form to fill in" class="form">
  <tr>
    <th>Types and<br />Breeds</th>

  </tr>
</table>

<p>3. <b>Market prices.</b> Pupils should record the market
prices of hogs in a tabular form, every day for a
period of two weeks. Such daily quotations may be
obtained from the newspaper. If possible, record the
number of the “run” of hogs which were offered for
sale at the market where prices are quoted. Note any
relation that may exist between price and number of
hogs.</p>

<p>4. <b>Inspection trips.</b> The class should make a tour
of the farms in the community where the various breeds
of swine may be studied. Note the distinguishing
characteristics. Use the following table in classifying
the distinguishing characteristics:</p>

<p>5. <b>Comparative judging.</b> Prepare a ring of swine,
two, three, or four animals, and have the pupils place
these according to rank, basing their judgment on form,
condition, and quality of the swine in the ring. In performing
this exercise it may be necessary for the instructor
to go over the whole matter of conformation,
condition, and quality as they should be found in good
swine.</p>

<p>6. <b>Exercises in judging.</b> After the pupils have
become somewhat familiar with the points in judging
swine, information may be given as to the judging of
individuals by the score cards. Under the direction
of the instructor use the score card of your State Experiment
Station.</p>

<p>7. <b>Reports on home feeding methods.</b> Let each
pupil report on the methods of feeding and managing
swine at home, using the following outline:</p>

<p>(a) The house, pen, or range in which the pigs are
fed for fattening.</p>

<p>(b) The feed used, amount, kind, etc.</p>

<p>(c) Criticism of the above methods, and suggestions
for improvement.</p>

<p>8. <b>Houses.</b> Pupils should bring pictures of hog
houses, clipped from farm papers or other publications
in which they may be found, and in class make a
critical study of the illustrations assembled. Ground
floor plans should be drawn by each student for several
types of house.</p>

<p>9. <b>Breed directory.</b> Let each pupil make a report<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
on the names of swine breeders in the locality and the
breeds raised. This may be made into a breed directory
for the community.</p>

<p>10. <b>Making a concrete hog wallow.</b><a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> A hog perspires
but little during hot weather and is forced to
seek a cool mud wallow if nothing else is provided.
This has resulted in the impression that the hog is a
dirty animal.</p>

<p>A concrete hog wallow provided with a drain will
enable the hog raiser to give his hogs a cool, clean
refuge from the heat. If a small amount of crude oil
is poured on the surface of the water, it will serve to
rid the animals of lice and keep the skin in good condition.
If possible, the wallow should be located near
the water supply, either a tank or spring. The following
sectional view of a wallow is taken from the Cement
News published by the Universal Portland Cement Co.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<p class="caption">1. <span class="smcap">Sectional View of a Concrete Wallow</span></p>
</div>

<p>It is recommended that the pool be made rectangular
with rounded corners. It should not have a depth of
more than 18 inches. The size should be determined

<p>11. <b>Wooden troughs for swine.</b> In figures 2 and
3 are shown two types of wooden troughs that are used
extensively by swine raisers. The one shown in figure 2
is designed for use in feeding young pigs. As shown
in the drawing it is shallow and is constructed with a
flat bottom and wide end pieces. The shallowness makes
it easy for the young pigs to get at the feed, and the
wide ends make it difficult for the pigs to overturn it.
The cross pieces prevent the hogs from lying in the
trough. The drawing gives all necessary dimensions.
Make out a bill of material and a bill of stock, cut the
pieces, and assemble them.</p>

<p class="caption">3. <span class="smcap">Trough for Mature Hogs</span></p>
</div>

<p>Figure 3 shows a V-shaped trough for older hogs.
Like the one shown for young pigs, it is wide at the
ends and is provided with cross pieces. The drawing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
gives all necessary dimensions. Make out bills of material
and stock, and construct.</p>

<p>12. <b>Hurdles for use in stock judging.</b> A hurdle as
described in this exercise is a panel of boards made as
shown in figure 4. Hurdles are portable and are useful
when sorting hogs into groups or when scoring and
judging them. Three or four hurdles fastened together
at the ends make a very good temporary pen.</p>

<p class="caption">4. <span class="smcap">Hurdle</span></p>
</div>

<p>The materials required are four pieces 1 by 4 inches
by 12 feet, one piece 2 by 4 inches by 8 feet, and 2
pounds of eightpenny common nails. To build the
panel, cut the pieces as shown in the drawing. Lay the
four pieces of 2 by 4 inches on the floor, spacing them
4 feet apart, nail the bottom board, space 2 inches and
nail the second board, space 3 inches and nail the third
board, and nail the fourth board on the top.</p>

<p>13. <b>Making a collection of feeds.</b> Secure a supply
of small bottles and make and label a collection of
samples of feeds suitable for pigs.</p>

<p>14. <b>Weighing pigs with steelyards.</b><a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> In the pig
project it is recommended that the pig or pigs be
weighed each week. Where stock or platform scales are
at hand the weighing can be performed easily, but, unfortunately,
some boys do not have scales of any kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
which they can use for this purpose. In project work
boys do not generally feel that they can afford to purchase
platform scales, but since the weighing is a very
important part of the work, some means should be provided,
and steelyards are suggested for the purpose.
These are not expensive, costing about $3.00, and with
proper arrangement can be used very satisfactorily.
For weighing feed they can usually be suspended from
joists in granaries, but for weighing the pig it will
probably be necessary to construct a horse from which
to suspend them. A crate also will be needed for holding
the pig while being weighed. The material required
for these articles is not expensive and both can be constructed
by the boys in the club or class.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Suggestions For Making Horse and Crate</span><a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></h3>

<p><b>Material.</b> Any ordinary lumber having proper
dimensions can be used. If new lumber is purchased,
yellow pine will serve the purpose satisfactorily, costing
2½c or 3c per lumber foot. The length suggested
for the horse is 8 feet, though this can be reduced by
placing the steelyards at right angles to the length of
the horse in place of in the same direction, as suggested
by the cut. The height should be 7 feet to provide
space for fastening the crate to the steelyards. The
legs should be beveled at upper ends before nailing to
rail and should be spread at bottom so as to measure
3½ feet. Stock required for constructing horse is as
follows: One piece 2″×6″×8′ if made eight feet long;
two pieces 2″×6″×14′; or 2″×4″×14′ for legs; two pieces
1″×6″×10′ for braces.</p>

<p>In place of the crate any box of the proper size can
be used for the purpose by nailing strips on the sides for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
convenience in handling, and for fastening rope to it.
If a crate is constructed it should be 4 or 4½ feet long,
2½ feet high, and 20 inches wide. The slats on one
end of the crate should be securely nailed, and on the
other they should be arranged to slide into place, so
that they can be removed easily after each weighing.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus5.jpg" width="500" height="325" alt="" />
<p class="caption">5. <span class="smcap">Arrangement for Weighing Pigs</span></p>
</div>

<p>The pig to be weighed is securely fastened in the
crate and the horse placed over it so that the ring or
hook of steelyards is nearly over the center. The crate
is then raised sufficiently to place 2×4 blocks under it,
and it is then fastened to the steelyards by means of a
chain or rope. The scale weight on the steelyards can
be approximately placed before the blocks are removed
from under the crate. To remove blocks, draw down
on long end of steelyards, which will raise the crate
from the blocks and allow them to be easily removed.
After the crate swings free the scale weight can be
carefully adjusted to ascertain exactly the gross weight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
of the pig and crate. The weight of pig can, of course,
be easily ascertained by subtracting the weight of crate
from the gross weight.</p>

<p>There are advantages in this arrangement for weighing,
in addition to its being inexpensive. The parts
can easily be moved from place to place without injury,
and can be placed in any pen or hog lot without difficulty,
which is not always the case with platform or
other scales.</p>

<span class="smaller">SWINE</span></h2>

<p><b>Origin.</b> The ancestors of the hogs found on American
farms came from two sources, southeastern Asia
and western Europe. These two families of hogs are
often designated by the names <i>Sus Indica</i> and <i>Sus
Scrofa</i>. Although the word <i>sus</i> is Latin, boys or girls
who feed pigs use it when they call “sui, sui,” to the
pigs at feeding time.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus6.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption">6. <span class="smcap">A Razor-Back</span></p>
</div>

<p><i>Sus Indica</i>, a native of China, was a small, fine-boned
animal much prized by the people of southeastern Asia.
Descendants of <i>Sus Scrofa</i>, the wild boar of western
Europe, are still hunted in forests and private game
preserves. The wild boar is a large, ferocious animal
with thin hams and a heavy shield. From its Chinese
ancestor the modern hog has derived its form and quality;
from the wild boar it has obtained its size and
vigor.</p>

<p>Swine were probably introduced into this country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
by early Spanish explorers. For many years wild hogs
were found in the everglades of Florida. It is recorded
that Jamestown had to be fenced to keep out
the wild hogs, descendants of those brought over by
earlier settlers. Although the ancestors of the hog
came from China and western Europe, it remained for
English breeders to blend the two and develop the
earlier breeds.</p>

<p>The earlier breeds like the Berkshire were developed
where corn is not grown successfully. Under such conditions
the bacon-type of hog was produced.</p>

<p><b>Bacon-type.</b> The bacon hog has a longer side, less
fat and a smaller ham. Canada, Denmark, and Ireland
produce the finest hogs of this type. Bacon hogs furnish
the “Wiltshire side,” in which ham, side, and shoulder
are marketed in one piece. This cut commands a higher
price on the European continent than pork from the
lard hog. The weight of this type of hog for market
varies from 160 to 200 pounds. The form of the
bacon-type is quite different from the form of the lard-type.
The hog has longer legs, the body is not so
thick or deep, the shoulders, neck, and jowls are lighter.
The hog should be longer from shoulder to ham, with
sufficient depth and thickness to denote good constitution.
Quality, as in the lard-type, is indicated by a
smooth coat of hair and an unwrinkled skin. The
finished bacon hog “handles” firmer to the touch than
a finished lard hog. The bones of this type are larger,
but they should present a clean-cut appearance. The
loin is the most valuable cut in this hog, and should
be as wide as the rest of the back, full, strong, and
well packed with flesh. The ribs should spring out
boldly from the backbone and turn sharply downward,
giving a straight, flat side. The leading breeds of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
bacon-type of swine are the Tamworth and the Large
Yorkshire. Sometimes the Hampshire is so classed.</p>

<p><b>Lard-type.</b> The lard hog is a native of the corn
belt. This type of hog has a compact, thick, deep,
smooth body. The ham, back, loin and shoulders are
the most valuable parts and are developed to a higher
degree. The production of lard and fat is the principle
aim of this type. Quality is denoted by fine hair,
smooth, clean, unwrinkled skin, rather fine bone, and
an even distribution of flesh. The jowls should be broad,
plump, and full, and the belly not baggy in appearance.
The hog should have short upright pasterns. The snout
should be fine, the face wide between the eyes, and
the space between the ears wide and full. Width between
the eyes and fullness and width between the ears
indicate a good feeder. The neck should be short and
deep and should blend smoothly into the shoulder. The
shoulder should be well developed, blending smoothly
into the body and covered evenly with flesh over all
parts. The back should be broad, slightly arched, of
medium length and thickly fleshed. The ribs should be
well sprung, the sides deep and even between the shoulders
and ham. The ham should be broad, deep, plump,
and heavily fleshed well down toward the hocks. The
rump should be as wide as the back. The legs should
be short, straight, set well apart and squarely under
the body. The above brief description is general for
all breeds of the lard hog. The Poland China, Chester
White, Berkshire, and Duroc-Jersey are the popular
breeds of this type of hog.</p>

<p><b>Breeds.</b> The selection of a good breed by a pig
club member is an important matter. He should be
influenced by two conditions: the breeds raised in the
community and his own preference. The community<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
which confines its efforts to two, or better, to one breed
of hog, will attract buyers and its stock will command
fancy prices. On the other hand, a breeder will be
most successful with the breed in which he has confidence.</p>

<p>To make an intelligent choice, every club member
should become familiar with the characteristics, advantages,
and shortcomings of the several breeds of hogs.
It should be borne in mind that there is no “best
breed.”</p>

<p class="caption">12. <span class="smcap">Large Yorkshire</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>The Large Yorkshire.</b> This large white breed, too,
originated in England. White spots are not desirable
and black hairs disqualify animals. The Large Yorkshire
possesses the typical bacon conformation: light
hams and shoulders, long legs and a long, narrow and
deep body. On account of its size, strong bone, and
ability to produce large litters, Yorkshire boars have
been used for crossing with breeds which are lacking in
these respects.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<p class="caption">13. <span class="smcap">Tamworth</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>The Tamworth.</b> This breed much resembles the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Large Yorkshire in size but has a longer snout. The
Tamworths are good rustlers and produce bacon which
can be used for export purposes at a comparatively
early age. They are sometimes criticized for their inability
to compete with the lard breeds in the production
of fat carcasses. It should be borne in mind,
however, that they are distinctly a bacon breed.</p>

<p>The Large Yorkshire and the Tamworth are the only
two bacon breeds in this country. Other minor breeds,
both lard and bacon, which might be mentioned are the
Mule-Foot, Small Yorkshire, Essex, Cheshire, Victoria
and Large Black.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Lard Breeds</span></h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus7.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption">7. <span class="smcap">Poland China</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>Poland China.</b> The Poland China is one of the most
popular breeds. It is of medium size, black in color
with “six white points” on face, tail and feet. Its ears
are not erect as are those of the Berkshire, but break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and fall forward about two-thirds of the length from
the head. The face is not dished as much as that of
the Berkshire, another mark of distinction.</p>

<p>Like all of the rest of the lard breeds, it should have
heavy shoulders and hind quarters, and deep, short
sides. For a time there was a demand upon the part
of breeders for small, fine-boned animals. The demand
of the packers was too strong, however, and the development
of the Big Type Poland China marked the
downfall of this “fad.”</p>

<p>This breed is noted for its constitution and vigor.
Much of this is due, no doubt, to the fact that the
originators of the breed in the Miami Valley wished to
develop a hog which could be driven to Cincinnati, the
great packing center of that period. The small type
Poland China had small litters. This fault has been
remedied in the big type strains.</p>

<p class="caption">8. <span class="smcap">Berkshire</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>The Berkshire.</b> The erect ears, dished face and
short snout of the Berkshire distinguish it quite sharply
from the Poland China. It is one of the oldest breeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
of swine, originating in Berkshire, a county of England.
The early Berkshire was a bacon, not a lard hog.
It was large, rough, and late maturing. Numerous
crosses with Chinese and Neopolitan pigs of fine quality
have been instrumental in producing the modern, medium
sized, compact animal.</p>

<p>This breed has a broad back, a good spring of rib
and thick rump and hams. Berkshires are early maturing
and breeders claim that the meat is second in
quality to none. Like the Poland China, it has white
on the feet, face and tip of tail.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus9.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption">9. <span class="smcap">Duroc-Jersey</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>Duroc-Jersey.</b> This breed of red hog is becoming
very popular on account of its constitution and ability
to produce large litters. It resembles the Poland China
in size, shape and position of ear and snout. The color
desired by most breeders is a cherry and not a sandy
red.</p>

<p>Nothing definite is known of its early history. Red
hogs had often been imported. Among the records of
such importations are those of Henry Clay from Spain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
and Daniel Webster from Portugal. Early Berkshires
of red color were thought to have been used in developing
the breed.</p>

<p>Two breeds, a Jersey Red in New Jersey and a Duroc
in New York State, came into prominence. The former
was a coarse hog of good length of body and strong
constitution. The union of these two breeds produced
the Duroc-Jersey.</p>

<p>Another point which especially recommends this breed
in addition to those already mentioned is its grazing
ability.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus10.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption">10. <span class="smcap">Chester White</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>The Chester White.</b> This breed of white hog resembles
the Poland China. The ears are more drooping,
however, than those of that breed and break forward
about one-third the distance from the head. The
Chester White is also wider, thicker and longer in body.</p>

<p>The breed originated in Chester County, Pennsylvania.
Two other strains, Todd’s Improved Chester
White and the Ohio Improved Chester White, have resulted
from breed improvement. The latter has now
developed its own breed association.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>The Chester White ranks second to Duroc-Jerseys in
the size of its litters, but the fact that its white color
makes it subject to sunburn prevents its development
in the southern and middle western states.</p>

<p><b>The Hampshire.</b> This breed is classed as between
the fat and bacon-types. This is due to a lighter
shoulder and ham and a longer side with less depth
than those of the breeds previously described. Although
it will not meet the demands of the “Wiltshire side”
for the English market, it will provide bacon which
meets the demands of the American market.</p>

<img src="images/illus11.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption">11. <span class="smcap">Hampshire</span></p>
</div>

<p>The Hampshire is a black hog with a belt of white
from 4 to 12 inches in width encircling the body and
including the forelegs. It is more upstanding than the
lard-type breeds, and has a broad and fairly deep body.
A narrow head with close set ears extending forward
but not breaking are other marks of distinction. The
Hampshire matures early, has good sized litters, and is a
good grazer. The proportion of fat to lean meat is
very desirable. Little is known of its early history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
other than that it originated in Hampshire, England,
and that representatives were brought to Kentucky at
an early date.</p>

<p><b>Selecting the pigs.</b> In choosing a breed a club
member will do well to select the one which is most
prevalent in his community, provided, of course, that
it is a breed which meets the market requirements and
in other ways is adapted to local conditions. This will
be the case if he lives in a community of successful
swine breeders.</p>

<p><b>Getting started.</b> After a breed has been decided
upon, the next thing is to pick out the individuals.
A pig club member may start with a pig or pigs after
weaning, or a bred gilt may be purchased.</p>

<p>Wherever possible a pure-bred sow pig or gilt should
be secured. Two things are to be considered, the pedigree
and individuality of the animal. Unless you are
familiar with pedigrees, it is best to leave that to the
reliable breeder with whom you are dealing. Every
pig club member, however, should be able to pick out a
good pig.</p>

<p>Four things should be considered in selecting a breeding
animal: form, quality, constitution, sex character
and type. It is true that the matter is more difficult
with a young pig than with an older pig, but part or
all of these conditions may be noted in the young pig.</p>

<p>A pig with a comparatively long body and with good
depth and width should be selected. It should stand
squarely on short legs of good bone. There should be
no wrinkles on the body.</p>

<p>A good heart girth indicates plenty of room for the
lungs and denotes a strong constitution. Quality is
shown in fineness of bone and hair. Too fine a bone
should be avoided. To judge type one must be familiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
with the requirements of the various breeds. Above
all, the pig selected should be a good feeder.</p>

<p><b>Care and management.</b> After the pig or pigs are
secured, the next problem is one of care and management.
Every pig club member should keep in mind
that pigs require a variety of clean food, clean water,
exercise and, a clean bed if they are to thrive and be
profitable. Being a large feeder the pig will eat dirty
food from a dirty trough if no other is offered. On
this account it is often thought that he will get along
under any sort of circumstances. Such is not the case.
No animal will respond more quickly to careful, intelligent
treatment than the pig.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus14.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption">14. <span class="smcap">A Good Hog House</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>Houses.</b> Hogs must be housed in dry, warm, clean,
and well-ventilated houses. Sunshine is a very important
agent in disinfecting and warming the hog
house. The well-established breeder may have a colony
house, but for the beginner the individual house of the
A or square type is to be recommended.</p>

<p>During the summer a good pasture will provide cheap,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
clean feed, exercise and a clean bed. It may be necessary,
however, to provide a shelter from the direct rays
of the sun. This may be furnished by a frame of poles
covered with straw or corn stalks.</p>

<p><b>Sanitation.</b> It is much easier to keep a pig healthy
than it is to cure him after he becomes sick. Cleanliness,
proper feed, disinfection of houses and animals,
together with plenty of sunlight, ventilation and dryness
of quarters, will help to keep a pig in good health.</p>

<p>If care is taken that there are no unnecessary cracks
or corners in which filth may accumulate, it will be
easy to keep houses, troughs and feeding floors sanitary.
A good disinfectant should be used regularly
in the pens. Five parts of crude carbolic acid in one
hundred parts of water is recommended. All filth
should be removed before the disinfectant is applied.
Once a year all buildings should be whitewashed. A
pint of crude carbolic acid should be added to each
three gallons of whitewash.</p>

<p>Feed lots and pastures cannot be disinfected in this
fashion, but applications of lime and an occasional
plowing will help.</p>

<p><b>Hog wallows and dips.</b> The pig is not naturally a
filthy animal, and if given an opportunity will keep
fairly clean. During the extreme heat of summer the
pig suffers, owing to the fact that he perspires but
little. He seeks the shelter of a cool mud wallow to get
relief from heat and parasites. The intelligent hog
raiser will provide a concrete wallow and keep it filled
with eight or ten inches of water. Coal-tar or crude
oil added to the water helps to rid the animal of lice.
Where the animals are badly infested with lice it will
be necessary to wet them all over, as the lice are found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
behind the ears, inside of the legs and in the folds of
the skin. A two per cent solution of creolin may be
used for this purpose.</p>

<p><b>Worms.</b> Pigs are often affected with worms which
interfere with their thriftiness. A tablespoonful of
castor oil and forty drops of oil of American wormseed
should be given in the slop to wormy pigs. Six
grains of santonin and four grains of calomel per 100
pound pig is also used successfully.</p>

<p><b>Hog cholera.</b> It is not possible within the scope of
a small book to describe all of the diseases that attack
pigs. Every pig club member, however, should know
something about hog cholera, the greatest scourge which
attacks swine.</p>

<p>The germs of hog cholera may be carried on the
boots of visitors, by pigeons or dogs. It can only be
combatted by vaccination of healthy hogs, quarantining
of all sick hogs, burning of all dead hogs and disinfection
of premises.</p>

<p>Three methods of vaccination are in use:</p>

<p>(1) The injection of an anti-cholera serum, which
makes the hog immune only a few months or weeks.</p>

<p>(2) The simultaneous treatment whereby the serum
used in (1) and the defibrinated blood or virus from
a diseased hog are injected together. This treatment
renders the hog immune for life.</p>

<p>(3) In the combination method, serum alone is
used first, and ten days later the simultaneous treatment
is administered. This method is seldom used.
The services of a skilled veterinarian should be secured
to vaccinate hogs.</p>

<p><b>Feeds and feeding.</b> Protein, fats, and carbohydrates
are the three classes of nutrients found in feeds.
These, in addition to mineral matter and water, furnish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
material for the maintenance and growth of the
pig. Proteins furnish the material for the production
of muscle. Fats and carbohydrates provide fuel for
heating the body and giving activity to the muscles.
An excess of food nutrients, especially fats and carbohydrates,
is stored in the body as fat. The mineral
matter goes into the production of bone.</p>

<p>All feeds do not contain these nutrients in the same
proportions. Some feeds, like corn, are deficient in protein,
while others, like tankage, contain a large percentage
of protein.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus15.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption">15. <span class="smcap">A Self-Feeder</span></p>
</div>

<p>From the foregoing it is easily seen that the problem
of the hog raiser is to use a combination of feeds
which will provide the proper proportions of the various
nutrients. While the pigs are young, bone and muscle
producing foods are especially necessary. Toward maturity
the percentage of fat producing foods may be
increased.</p>

<p><b>Corn, pasture and other supplements.</b> Corn is the
most widely used feed for pigs. As has been stated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
it is essentially a fat producing food and must be properly
supplemented. Clover or alfalfa pasture supplies
the protein and part of the mineral matter which the
corn lacks. Rape furnishes good pasture for hogs, almost
equal to clover and alfalfa. Rye, blue grass, cow peas
and soy beans together with various pasture mixtures
have value as hog pastures. Where pigs are fed in a
dry lot, tankage may be used to supply the protein.
Pasture-fed pigs are thriftier and make cheaper gains
than those fed in a dry lot. Skim-milk or buttermilk
together with tankage makes an ideal supplement to
corn. Middlings and shorts may also be used.</p>

<p><b>Mineral matter.</b> To insure pigs getting enough
mineral matter it is recommended that the following
mixture be kept before them at all times:<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<table summary="Mineral mix for pigs">
  <tr>
    <td>Wood ashes or coal screenings</td>
    <td>1 bushel</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Air-slaked lime</td>
    <td>8 quarts</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Salt</td>
    <td>8 quarts</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Rock phosphate</td>
    <td>3 quarts</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Copperas (iron sulphate)</td>
    <td>1 quart</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The first four ingredients should be mixed thoroughly
and the copperas dissolved in warm water and poured
over the mixture.</p>

<p><b>Feeding and care of the sow.</b> In starting in the
swine industry with one or more gilts, it should be
borne in mind that a sow should not be bred until she
is eight or ten months of age. Every hog raiser should
aim to have his sows produce two litters a year, farrowing
in April and October.</p>

<p>Not more than two-thirds of the grain ration should
be corn. Some feeders prefer to use ground oats and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
middlings exclusively. In any event, heating and fattening
foods should be avoided. In addition to the
grain ration, roots and clover or alfalfa hay or skim-milk
should be fed. Sows on good pasture require little
grain except just before farrowing.</p>

<p>At farrowing time the sow should be placed in a
building, dry, free from draughts, and well-ventilated.</p>

<p>The feed after farrowing should be about the same
as before. After the first week larger quantities are
necessary for the sow in order to maintain the pigs
properly. When the pigs are weaned, the feed of
the sow should be cut down to check the flow of milk.
Oats is recommended for that purpose.</p>

<p><b>Feeding the pigs.</b> The young pigs will learn to eat
at about three weeks of age. At this time if the pigs
can be fed separately from the sow better results will
be obtained. Skim-milk, middlings and soaked corn
are recommended.</p>

<p>Young pigs should be given opportunity for exercise
but should be sheltered from cold winds or hot
sun. Young pigs may be weaned at from 8 to 10
weeks. Avoid too heavy feeding at first.</p>

<p>Pasture-fed pigs may be given one-fourth of a pound
of tankage, or one and one-half to two pounds of skim-milk
or buttermilk per day; one-half pound of middlings
may be added to the above ration. Adding bran
or finely ground oats to the middlings will prevent constipation
in case the middlings are too fine and floury.</p>

<p>What corn is readily cleaned up may be fed at the
age of three months or a little earlier if skim-milk is
being fed. The pigs should be fed four times a day at
first and then three times. As the pigs grow older the
corn and middlings may be increased, but at no time
should corn alone be fed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Markets.</b> The successful stock man is the one who
is familiar with market requirements and tries to meet
them. Every pig club member should know something
of the market classes and grades of hogs. These differ
somewhat according to local conditions, but in a general
way the classification used on the Chicago market may
be taken as a standard.</p>

<p>Heavy hogs are no longer at a premium except when
the price of lard is high. They contain a large amount
of fat. The various grades of hogs in the several
classes indicate the degree to which they have attained
to the standard of perfection, prime being the highest
grade, and common and inferior the lowest grades.</p>

<p>Butcher hogs are commonly used for fresh meat trade.
They are principally barrows.</p>

<p>The term packing refers to the use to which this class
of hogs is commonly put. They are inferior to butcher
hogs and are cut up, cured, and packed in boxes and
barrels. Mixed packing hogs are those marketed without
grading. Speculators often buy them up and grade
them.</p>

<p>The meat of pigs is unsuitable for curing and supplies
part of the demand for cheap, fresh meat.</p>

<p>Bacon hogs quoted on the Chicago market are not
the bacon hogs which furnish the Wiltshire sides. They
are lard hogs that are not highly finished, have a high
per cent of lean meat, and supply the demand for lean
pork.</p>

<p>Stags are males castrated too late in life to grade as
barrows. Boars are used for sausage and supply cheap
fresh meat.</p>

<p>The present demand is for hogs weighing from 200
to 250 pounds, and the hog raiser should aim to finish
and market his hogs at about these weights.</p>

<h3>PARLIAMENTARY PRACTICE HINTS AND SUGGESTIONS</h3>

<p><i>a.</i> Always address the president as Mr. or Miss President.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> All remarks should be addressed to the president.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> There should be no talking between members.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> The president should recognize the person who seeks
the floor by saying: “Mr. or Miss ____.”</p>

<p><i>e.</i> This indicates that the person thus recognized has the
privilege of speaking (of the floor) and must not be interrupted.</p>

<p><i>f.</i> The only interruptions allowable are (1) a call for a
point of order, or (2) a question.</p>

<p><i>g.</i> A point of order applies to a member who has made a
motion which is out of order because of another motion before
the meeting, or to a member whose remarks are not on the
subject under consideration, or to a person who is exceeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the time limit for discussion, etc. A point of order is executed
as follows:</p>

<p>Member rising while another is speaking: “Mr. President,
I rise to a point of order.”</p>

<p>The president will then recognize the speaker as follows:
“Mr. ____, please state your point of order.”</p>

<p>Member who has interrupted speaker: “Mr. President, the
speaker, Mr. ____ <span class="smaller">(Interrupted member’s
name)</span> is out of order because his
remarks are not on the subject under consideration (or is out
of order because there is another motion before the meeting).”</p>

<p>President: “The chair decides that the point is (or is not)
well taken.”</p>

<p>Whereupon the interrupted speaker takes his seat or makes
an appeal from the decision of the chair as follows:</p>

<p>Interrupted speaker: “Mr. President, I appeal from the
decision of the Chair.”</p>

<p>President: “Mr. ____ appeals from the decision
of the chair. As many as are in favor of sustaining the
decision of the chair will make manifest by saying ‘Aye;’
contrary-minded, ‘No.’”</p>

<p>The motion is (or is not) carried.</p>

<p>If the motion is carried, and the decision of the chair is
thus sustained, the interrupted speaker has no further recourse
and must take his seat. If, however, the motion is
lost and the decision of the chair is not sustained, the speaker
may continue to speak.</p>

<p>Question. The speaker may be interrupted by any member
for the purpose of asking a question. This question may be
one of personal privilege or may be for the purpose of gaining
information about the subject under discussion. The execution
of this motion may proceed as follows:</p>

<p>Member taking floor while another member is speaking:
“Mr. President, I rise to a question of information.”</p>

<p>Presiding officer: “State your question.”</p>

<p>Member: “Do I understand the speaker to mean that
____ etc.?”</p>

<p>The speaker then proceeds to give the information desired,
and the meeting proceeds.</p>

<p>In case of a question of personal privilege the process is as
follows:</p>

<p>Member, rising and interrupting speaker: “Mr. President,
I rise to a question of personal privilege.”</p>

<p>Presiding officer: “State your question.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Member: “Mr. President, this room is too warm for comfort,
and I therefore ask to have the windows opened.”</p>

<p>In either case the presiding officer may rule for or against
the person asking the question.</p>

<p><i>h.</i> Never offer a motion by saying, “I move you—,” but
simply with “I move, etc.”</p>

<p><i>i.</i> Never offer a motion while another motion is still before
the meeting.</p>

<p><i>j.</i> Before any matter is voted upon the presiding officer
must state the motion fully and completely.</p>

<p><i>k.</i> The ordinary form of voting upon regular motions is as
follows: Presiding officer: “All in favor of this motion say
‘Aye’ (a short pause for the vote); contrary, ‘No.’” The presiding
officer then announces the result by saying: “The
motion is carried,” or “The motion is lost.”</p>

<p><i>l.</i> Motions for question of privilege or point of order take
precedence over all other motions.</p>

<p><i>m.</i> Never attempt to place too many amendments to a
motion. (Two are allowable; that is, an amendment to an
amendment.) It is usually much better to offer a substitute
motion.</p>

<p><i>n.</i> A motion may not be put to a vote of the meeting until
it has been seconded or supported by some member other than
the one making the motion.</p>

<p><i>o.</i> In case of tie votes the president or presiding officer
decides the motion.</p>

<p><i>p.</i> A motion to adjourn the meeting is in order at any time.</p>

<p>In addition to these simple rules which may serve for the
beginning of the club’s activities, each club library should contain
a modern work on parliamentary practice.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Suggestive Programs for Agricultural Clubs</span></h3>

<p>The programs for club meetings will depend largely
on the type of project, the time to be devoted to meetings,
and the originality of the leader. There should
be something for everyone to do; each individual should
have some share in each club meeting.</p>

<p>The general program might divide itself into: (1)
project; (2) business, literary, and demonstration;
(3) social. No one of these three divisions can be
carried on exclusive of the others. The projects will
have their stories, the literary programs will sometimes
include project demonstrations, while the social spirit
should always be present.</p>

<p>It would be well to combine as much of a “do”
program as possible with the literary work. Demonstrations,
“stunts,” and contests always add interest.
Do not forget that music is always a welcome addition
to a club program. The following suggestions are given
merely to assist the club in arranging for the year’s
work. Further suggestions may be obtained by studying
the programs of projects other than yours. Meetings
should be held at least once a month, perhaps
oftener at certain seasons of the year. They may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
held in the schoolhouse Friday afternoon, and the young
pupils and others, not members of the club, may be
guests. Occasional evening meetings with social features
and refreshments should be held.</p>

<p>In the conduct of club meetings a good club leader
(or teacher) will remain in the background as much as
possible, permitting the officers of the club to conduct
the meeting. Parents, patrons, members of the advisory
committee, and outside speakers should have a place
on certain programs, but it should ever be borne in
mind that the club is for boys and girls, and care should
be exercised that the adults do not crowd them off the
programs. A club will be far more successful if it succeeds
in stimulating its own members to take part in
club meetings, than if it merely fills up its programs
with outside speakers.</p>

<p>In connection with the club meetings, visits should
be made to places where actual club work can be observed.
The corn plat, the pig pen, and the garden
should be utilized in this connection. Observation trips
and “hikes” should be taken to observe ideal conditions
on farms or in homes.</p>
